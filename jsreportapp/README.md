## Steps to run the jsreport server

* npm install -g jsreport-cli
* npm install
* jsreport start

### Accesing the templates
After start the project it runs on port 5488 so you can visit http://localhost:5488/ to access jsreport studio. It display the current template example with some css for styling and also the use of javascript to display the date.

The template is all develop on html with handlerbars to write the json information

#### Advantages
* Easy to configure
* Easy to use the Studio tool
* Flexible (you can include css, js, data (json))
* PDF is not the only option
* Free to use and Fork
* It removes the complexity to directly deal with headless chrome.
* It can works in most of the browser (i didnt run a test in  IE)
* They have a client library to work with frontend frameworks like Ember js
* Well documented and they have guides

#### Drawback
* The Studio library is free only for  5 templates, but in this case works pretty fine
